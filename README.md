PREDICTING BUILDING DAMAGE CAUSED BY EARTHQUAKE

Earthquake is one of the most hazardous natural calamities. It occurs due to sudden shaking of ground which is caused by movement of seismic waves. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel. Earthquake can cause devastating loss of life and property. The assessment of damage level of post-earthquake structures through calculations is always complicated and time-consuming, and it is not suitable for situations when a large number of buildings need to be evaluated after an earthquake. One of the largest post-disaster datasets, which comes from the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, makes it possible to train models to predict damage levels based on building information. Here, we investigate the application of various machine learning methods to the problem of structural damage level prediction. The problem statement of this project is determining the degree of damage that is done to buildings, thus when an earthquake occur, we can help identify safe and unsafe buildings, thus avoiding death and injuries resulting from aftershocks. Leveraging the power of machine learning is one viable option that can potentially prevent massive loss of lives while simultaneously making rescue efforts easy and efficient.
